            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is ideal and great for anyone. It is a system where once you save and update something you have made changes to, you are able to go back to the previous version and look at all the changes you've made and even save and continue editing from a previous file. Version Control is great for a team to use because you can see who made changes if it might be causing a problem. If you are a graphic designer, or web designer this is essential for you to use to see how far you have come on projects, or if you have saved your project but realize you like how it was previously you are able to go back to the previous file state. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. There are a couple different types of version control. Local, centralized, and distrubited version control systems. They all have small varities to them but pratically the same idea. For example the centralized version control system can have multiple version's of the files but on 2 different computers this is an example where multiple people could be working on a file together on separate computers.   </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git may be similar to other VCS but the difference is the way it thinks and interprets its data. Think of your file system on your computer. You see all the folders you have, as well as when you click on the folder you are able to see its contents which may be a word document, excell file, an image etc. You don't see the contents but more so a screenshot of the files contained in the folder. Once you save the files, git thinks of your files as they are when you save it and what they look like so it knows where things are as a reference. There is about 3 stages in using Git commit, modified and staged. Committed means that your data is successfuly stored, basically successfuly saved. Modified means that you have modified or changed your file but have not yet updated or commited/saved your file. Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I'm just going to cover a few of the basic and needed git commands that you would need to know. Git init: initializes the repository. (Which is the space you can save local files to) Git add: Which adds all the files that were changed since the last back up. Git commit -m: Which commits the files and changes to the local repository. Git push: pushes the changes from the local repository to the remote repository. Git pull: pulls the changes from local to remote repository. The difference between Git push and Git pull is, git push is used to add commits you have done on the local repository to a remote one - together with git pull , it allows people to collaborate. git commit record your changes to the local repository. git push update the remote repository with your local changes, basically git push means upload. So once you push it, everything you have changed will be uploaded.  Git log: shows all the backups in the repository. Git status: shows all the files that were changed since the last backup. Git Diff: shows the differences between the working directory and back-ups created in the repository. Git reset: undo's your last save. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is the largest place for Git repositories. It isnt a direct source of the project, there is a huge chance that you will need to use GitHub professionally.The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository. A git repository contains, among other things, the following: A set of commit objects. A set of references to commit objects, called heads. To create a commit you need to do a couple things; Tell Git which files to include in the commit, with git add. If a file has not changed since the previous commit, Git will automatically include it in the commit you are about to perform. Therefore you only need to add files that you have newly created or modified. Note that it adds directories recursively, so git add . will add everything that has changed. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Different types of Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are 3 different types of version control, Centralized, Distributed, and Local. To separate the different types for you and how to tell their uses apart I will help break them down for you. Local Version control system is the easiest of the 3. Most people use it to cope files into their directory, but this is an easy way to make mistakes. To fix the common issue people continued to make, programmers developed RCS. RCS is a system that works to keep all the differences between files separate in a separate place. Distributed Version control is not just a snapshot of the files as we once talked before, but more of a full clone backup incase you completley lose everything you have all that you lost still right in front of you. Centralized Version control has a single server with all the versioned files. This way multiple clients and members of a team can sorta check out the files that they need all from one hub. This has its perks you are able to see what everyone else is working on and how far along they are. It is easy this way to work toward a similar goal, especially on a time frame. There are downsides to this type of VCS though. If the server goes down you aren't able to work on it including no one on the project which can cause some serious down time. Another downfall that can occur is if the hard drive of the VCS completley fails you lose absouletly everything. There are alwaysing gonig to be upsides and downsides with working in version control, but usually the positives outweigh the negative.   </p>
